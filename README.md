# The Raspiator Project

At our work, a *Radiator* is an information or status display, showing how the
servers or integrations are doing, or basically any other stat. You've seen
status displays in the movies. These are ours. 

A *Raspiator* is a Radiator built on a Raspberry Pi, running the
[Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org) image with customisations from the
[Watershed display
project](http://blogs.wcode.org/2013/09/howto-boot-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-fullscreen-browser-kiosk/).
I'll integrate those bits here eventually. I've also had inspiration from the
[Screenly](https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose) project.

This repo exists so that i can compile the stuff needed to run it all. There's
nothing very fancy here yet. In fact, there is only a little script to turn the
screensaver on and off on a schedule, but eventually i hope to add even fancy
[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible) management things to the server side. 

So all in all, nothing here to be excited about. Yet.
